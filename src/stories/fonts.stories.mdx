## Fonts

The following is a list of typography definitions available on the application.

<Story id="foundation-fonts--noto-sans" height="830px" />

These can be simply used as classes on any HTML element. For instance:

```
<h1 class="mat-display-1">
  LATEST NEWS
</h1>
```

## ðŸ”§Adding/overwriting fonts

To modified the classes `font size`, `line height`, or `font weight` the file `src/assets/scss/material.typography.scss` can be updated.
If a new class is required the list `orcid-custom-typography` can be appended with more definitions.

For instance

Add add a new class call `.giant-text`

```
$orcid-custom-typography: (
  // the parameters are font-size, line-height, and font-weight
  giant-title: mat-typography-level(250px, normal, 600),
  ...
)
```

#### Importing more fonts

Currently, only some NotoSans fonts files are declared on the application CSS.
If a new weight or style of NotoSans is needed the file `src/assets/scss/noto-sans.scss`
has the `notosans-fontface` mixin that can be included to add any of the available fonts on the folder
`src/assets/fonts/noto-sans`.

For instance

Add a new font file to the CSS to support italics on 400 weight

```
// added to `src/assets/fonts/noto-sans`
@include notosans-fontface('Thin', 400, italic);
```

If any other font family is required it might be manually added into the SASS files or the index.html.
