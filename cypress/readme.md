# How to run

Before the following steps make sure to have `npm` and `yarn` installed

1- Create your own `cypress/cypress.env.js` file based on the `cypress/cypress.env.sample.js` file.

2- Run the following command

```
yarn
yarn run cypress:open
```

**Note:** To run this on QA the same parameters of the sample file should just work, and to run this on a local environment you will need to provide your own parameters.

# How to generate a sharable HTML report
